# A blog on data science and software dev

The posts are in reverse order by date (the latest is at the top).  My posts tend to be more like tutorials around exciting projects I've come across in my career.

My name is Micheleen Harris (Twitter: [@rheartpython](https://twitter.com/rheartpython)) and I'm interested in data science, have taught it some and am still learning much.  I try not to have post titles soley for "click-through" value, but sometimes I do get excited.

I'm currently fascinated by:

  - Deep learning for computer vision and NLP (really keen on PyTorch lately)
  - The Jupyter project
  - OpenCV-Python
  - Building simple algorithms for deep learning
  - Chatbots some of the time
  - Speech to text
  - Creating websites
  - ML on the Edge (IoT)
