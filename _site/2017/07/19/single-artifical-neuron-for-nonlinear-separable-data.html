    <p><strong>tl:dr</strong>:  Getting a simple, predictive framework distinguishing two types of leukemia based on biological markers from a single-layer neural network was not the intent of this exercise. It is, however, indicative of the power of a single artificial neuron and thoughtful feature reduction.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The intent of this post originally was to show the inner workings and limitations of a single artificial neuron using some moderately complex, noisy data; a challenge of sorts - “is this noisy data linearly separable with a single artificial neuron and if not, why is that?”.</p>

<p>However, I found with some data and algorithm exploration, that I could distinguish between two types of leukemia — a naive approach and not really biologically significant, but an interesting outcome nonetheless.  So, even though this post is about the data science, it also touches on a potential method to use in the real world.</p>

<p>In this post, you’ll find information on the use of PCA for data reduction/feature engineering, scaling and normalization for preprocessing, the Adaline algorithm (artificial neuron), different activation functions, among other topics and concepts.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-an-adaline-artificial-neuron">What is an Adaline artificial neuron</h3>

<p>The ADAptive LInear NEuron (Adaline) algorithm is very similar to a Perceptron (simplest of the artificial neurons) except that in the Perceptron the weights are updated based on a unit step activation function output (see figure below) whereas Adaline uses a linear activation function to update it’s weights giving it a more robust result (that even converges with samples that are not completely separable by a linear hyperplane, unlike the Perceptron).  In Adaline a <em>quantizer</em> after the activation function, is used to then predict class labels.</p>

<p>Beyond the linear activation function and the <em>quantizer</em>, we see the use of a <em>cost function</em>, or <em>objective function</em>, to update the weights.  In this case we want to minimize this function with an optimization method.  The optimization of the <em>cost function</em> happens with yet another function aptly and simply named an <em>optimization function</em>.  In this case our optimization function is <em>stochastic gradient decent</em>, which one can of as “climbing down a hill” (using part of the data to calculate, shuffled as well) to get to the minima of the cost function’s convex curve (as it updates weights iteratively from a shuffled dataset).</p>

<p>A really great discussion from which much of this information was adapted can be found in Sebastian Raschka’s <em>Python Machine Learning</em> book (link <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning">here</a>) and excellent blog post on this topic <a href="http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_singlelayer_neurons.html">here</a> on the single-layer neurons.</p>

<h3 id="adaline-with-a-sigmoid-activation-function">Adaline with a sigmoid activation function</h3>

<p>I grabbed Raschka’s ADAptive LInear NEuron (Adaline) classifier open-source code <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Machine-Learning/blob/master/3547_02_Code.ipynb">here</a> (the AdalineSGD class) and updated the activation function to logistic sigmoid from a linear function.</p>

<p>Note, with the Adaline (versus the Perceptron) we use a continuous number rather than the binary class label, to compute the model error and update the weights.  Then to predict a class label, another function is used called a <em>quantizer</em>.  Also, the weights are updated in a more sophisticated manner.</p>

<p><strong>We still get linear classification boundaries</strong></p>

<p>These single-neuron classifiers can only result in linear decision boundaries, even if using a non-linear activation, because it’s still using a single threshold value, <code class="highlighter-rouge">z</code> as in diagram above, to decide whether a data point is classified as 1 or -1.</p>

<h3 id="the-noisy-data">The noisy data</h3>

<p>The data was downloaded from the Machine Learning Data Set Repository <a href="https://mldata.org">mldata.org</a> using a convenience function from <code class="highlighter-rouge">scikit-learn</code>.</p>

<p>The data is a small, but wide acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) vs. acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) dataset.  It has approximately 7000 biological markers (our features), vs. 72 samples (our data points).</p>

<p>Given the noisy nature of the data and possible skewedness, it was standardized and normalized with convenience functions from <code class="highlighter-rouge">scikit-learn</code>:</p>

<p>I tried just one feature reduction with PCA to reduce all 7129 dimensions to 2D at first.  However, I could not separate out the ALL samples from AML - this wasn’t necessarily important to my post on Adaline neurons I was writing, but I decided to try something I’d read about recently for kicks.  In fact the idea sprung from a comment in a Python script where a perceptron was used to create non-linear separation of data for a plot (from <a href="https://github.com/daniel-e/pymltools/blob/master/plot_scripts/plot_perceptron_nonlin.py">this</a> script on Github).  The comment went:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># map the data into a space with one addition dimension so that
# it becomes linearly separable
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So, I gave it a shot.</p>

<h3 id="3d-to-run-through-network-and-2d-to-gain-insights">3D to run through network and 2D to gain insights</h3>

<p>My next step was to try feeding the neural network the data in 3D space (the 3 features or components from the first PCA reduction).</p>

<p>I then reduced the 3D data to 2D, mainly to visualize it.  A hyperplane was drawn (blank dashed line) to represent the decision boundary.  The surface in the diagram below is representative of a sigmoidal output along the direction of the weight vector.</p>

<p><img src="/jekyll-slender-template/img/single_layer_neuron/linearly_sep_leukemia.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Full code <a href="https://github.com/michhar/python-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/machine_learning/leukemia_notebook.ipynb">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/michhar/python-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/machine_learning/adaline_sgd.py">here</a>.</p>

<p>Note, the stochastic part of the single-neuron optimizer, stochastic gradient decent, causes some variation in the results if run again.  It might be a good idea to do a batch version of the Adaline neuron.  Another note is that one does not necessarily have to use a logistic sigmoidal activation function; it was just used here as an experiment and to prove to myself I’d always get a linear decision boundary.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion-from-my-experiment">Conclusion from my experiment</h3>

<p>I was surprised and impressed that I got a linearly separable result!  Albeit, that was not the intent of this exercise, but indicative of the power of a single neuron and thoughtful feature reduction.  It makes me wonder what a small neural network could do!</p>
