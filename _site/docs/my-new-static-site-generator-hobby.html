<p><strong>tl:dr</strong>:  A little post on using static site generators to overlay a website on top of a GitHub repo for displaying docs, portfolios/products, and blogs.</p>

<p><strong>Posted</strong>:  2017-06-18</p>

<p>I recently discovered I can have a static website for each of my GitHub repositories, which seems like overkill for 35+ repos.  That being said, it certainly would be nice to attractively present some of my content I’ve painstakingly written in Markdown files to showcase my work.</p>

<p>Using static site generators, like Jekyll or MkDocs (and others — good article <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/static-site-generator.html">here</a>) combined with a templating engine like Jinga, opens up a lovely world of having human-friendly interfaces on top of my repos that I want to share.  The complexity of the sites can get quite intricate — to my hearts content.</p>

<p>Markup languages like Markdown are pretty easy to write in and create text files with headings, lists, tables and such (GitHub made a nice guide <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">here</a>).  However, if you like reStructuredText or HTML better there are generators out there for you.</p>

<p>There’s a great site to shop for a Jekyll theme (where I began this journey), <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">here</a>.  They are mostly slanted towards blog writers as that was the reason for the genesis of Jekyll by the founder of GitHub (thanks Tom Preston-Werner!  Find out more about Jekyll on <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/static-website-generators-jekyll-middleman-roots-hugo-review/#jekyll">this</a> blog).</p>

<p>There is of course the use of GitHub Pages to simply render the repo’s README markdown file by clicking on <strong>Settings</strong> and scrolling down to <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, then selecting a theme directly at that point.</p>

<p>Basically, I’m just scratching the surface here on another way.  Also, the generators I chose all look good on hand-held devices - an important aspect to consider.</p>

<p>These are some scenarios for the site generators I’m introducing based on research and actual work I’ve done:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Chalk</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Blogs</li>
      <li>Things listed by dates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Webjeda Cards</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Blogs</li>
      <li>Portfolios</li>
      <li>Modular presentations e.g. product cards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>MkDocs</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Documentation</li>
      <li>Guides or tutorials</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With the following information, hopefully you can begin to successfully build sites based on these generators.  I hope to fork them at some point for contributing back and encourage you to do so if you figure out something useful.</p>

<p>Clarification on project setups:  some themes or static site generators that use repositories for content, have a branch for building the site (source) and a branch (usually called <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code>) for the sites deployment files (MkDocs sites do this).  Some themes just work under <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> or have a mirrored dev branch.</p>

<h3 id="chalk">Chalk</h3>

<p><img src="/img/sitegenpost/chalk_main.png" alt="Chalk screenshot" /></p>
<p align="right"><b>Chalk demo site</b></p>

<p><em>Chalk is a high quality, completely customizable, performant and 100% free blog template for Jekyll.</em></p>

<p>Chalk is my favorite Jekyll theme for blogging.  It’s simple and clean in its look.  However, Chalk doesn’t support the standard way of working with Jekyll on GitHub pages due to custom plugins.  There’s a little bit more complexity around building the site with these plugins, but all of the scripts are provided so it’s actually quite easy in the long run to build and deploy to GitHub Pages or another hosting service.</p>

<p>Check out these sites:</p>

<p><a href="http://chalk.nielsenramon.com/">Demo site</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk">Chalk GitHub repo</a></p>

<p>Recommended tweaks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the dark code highlighting theme inside of the light Chalk theme for a Sublime Editor-like effect.  Modify an import at the bottom of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/_assets/stylesheets/light.scss</code>:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> @import "modules/highlights-dark";
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add an icon to the post listing page (main page) by editing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> tag:</p>

    <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"article-list-tags"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">""</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">"post logo"</span> 
       <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">""</span> 
       <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">"30%"</span> <span class="na">align=</span><span class="s">"center"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</span>
 <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>And adding the <code class="highlighter-rouge">post.logo</code> to the YAML heading on the post as in:</p>

    <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> ---
 ...
 comments: true
 description: A short chatterbot dev story
 logo:  "../resources/images/ocrbot_local.png"
 tags:
 ...
 ---
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="webjeda-cards">Webjeda Cards</h3>

<p><img src="/img/sitegenpost/webjeda_main.png" alt="Webjeda screenshot" /></p>
<p align="right"><b>Webjeda demo site</b></p>

<p><em>Webjeda Cards is a Bootstrap based jekyll theme for portfolio, photography or any kind of blog.</em></p>

<p>Creator’s Profile:  <a href="https://github.com/sharu725">https://github.com/sharu725</a></p>

<p>This Jekyll theme is fantastic for more modular postings (like course or product listings).  It could also be a great place to show off your work like photos you’ve taken with a nice write-up.  Perhaps, this could be the main page of your site and you could link to all of the repos you’d like to share from this card layout design.</p>

<p>Setup note:  you can of course simply use the master branch here for building <em>and</em> deploying, but it’s always nice to have a separate branch we often see called <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> for the sites actual deployed content.</p>

<p>Check out these sites:</p>

<p><a href="http://webjeda.com/cards/">Demo site</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sharu725/cards">Webjeda Cards GitHub repo</a></p>

<p>Recommended tweaks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> added a variable to automatically pull in the “Read” button name (so, instead of just “Read” it’s a custom label on the button).  This is done with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">post.label</code>:</p>

    <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"panel-body"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;h3</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"panel-title pull-left"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"post-meta pull-right"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">""</span> 
      <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"btn btn-primary btn-sm pull-right mt10"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      Go to <span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, in the post you’ll have a YAML header with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">label</code> variable like:</p>

    <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  ---
  layout: post
  title:  Microsoft R Server and SQL Server R Services Labs
  categories: mrs
  img: hikeclouds.jpg
  label: Labs
  resource:
  ---
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is a great alternative to a Sphinx build for a readthedocs style documentation page.  It’s very easy to setup and use.  There are other builtin themes as well.  It’s fairly pre-baked, but very good for what it’s good for.</p>
